    The first generation computer is a cmputer that uses vacuum tubes for logic circuitry.

    The electric circuit played the role of program.
    \vspace{4ex}

    \onslide+<2->{It was impossible to update the program.}
    \vspace{4ex}

    \onslide+<3->{The engineers had to designe the building, the logic and the circuit \textcolor{red}{at once.}}
    \vspace{4ex}

    {\footnotesize Honestly speaking, I don't think it was a program because it was not turing-complete.}

\begin{frame}{Colossus}{The First Generation Computer}
    The electric circuit played the role of program as well.

    \onslide+<2->{It is said that the user could change the wiring to update the program.}

    i.e. Wiring extracted a part of logic from the circuit.

    ENIAC had undergone changes over the year.

\begin{frame}{ENIAC}{The First Generation Computer}
    ENIAC stored a program in electornically accessible memory.

    \onslide+<2->{The users could create a new program anytime.}

\begin{frame}{ENIAC}{The First Generation Computer}
    The program in the memory extracted the logic from the circuit.
